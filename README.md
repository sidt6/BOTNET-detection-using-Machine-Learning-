# BOTNET-detection-using-Machine-Learning-
 (UNSW) datasets are used to build four machine learning models. The decision trees model produced the best overall results with 100% testing accuracy, 100% precision, 100% recall, and 100% F-score in detecting botnet assaults using 82,000 records from the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Our overall result is 99.63%.
