# BOTNET-detection-using-Machine-Learning-
In this study, machine learning is used to identify Botnet assaults. The Bot-IoT and University of New South Wales (UNSW) datasets are used to build four machine learning models based on the Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees classifiers. The decision trees model produced the best overall results with 100% testing accuracy, 100% precision, 100% recall, and 100% F-score in detecting botnet assaults using 82,000 records from the UNSW-NB15 dataset. We have run 10,000 data records. Our overall result is 99.63%.
